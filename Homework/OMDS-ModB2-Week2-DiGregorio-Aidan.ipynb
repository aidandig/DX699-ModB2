    "Who:\n",
    "- This dataset would be useful for policymakers, environmental and climate change advocates, and regulators seeking to monitor large oil, gas, coal, and cement producers and their emissions. For example, this could be presented to a congressional subcommittee that deal with the energy industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "What:\n",
    "- Based on the findings of the dataset, Environmental and climate change advocates should take these findings of the largest CO2 producers and advocate for bold climate policies in order to further along the transition from dirty energy to clean energy while having stricter emissions policies. The policymakers and regulators should take action by adopting or creating new regulations for stronger enforcement of emissions levels in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall the tone of the presentation of these findings should have a serious and urgent tone, but one that is also empowering the audience because they are in positions of power to create positive change.\n",
    "\n",
    "How:\n",
    "- In order to effectively deliver this information to the audience, highlighting the before and after effect of emissions from these companies would be an attention grabber in order to understand the gravity of what is happening. Providing supplemental information about the share of emissions these companies have in comparison to the rest of the market could potentially be a beneficial comparison to make in order to fully understand the effect these few companies have. The presentation should focus on the big idea where these small number of companies are contributing to a significant proportion of global emissions and that we must have systemic decarbonization efforts.\n"

    "Just like last week: choose any graph in the Introduction of Storytelling With Data (p. 1-17). Use matplotlib to reproduce it in a rough way. I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph. However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that. You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."
